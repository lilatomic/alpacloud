# Alpacloud

Alpacloud is my little cloud. This repo contains the tools that I use for building it.

## Tools

- alpacloud-ansible-builder : a tool to automatically build and install Ansible Collections

## Collections

- lilatomic.api : api helpers, like a better way of making HTTP Requests
- lilatomic.azcli : invoke the azure-cli from ansible
